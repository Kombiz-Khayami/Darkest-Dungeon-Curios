# Darkest Curios

An site for the game Darkest Dungeon. It helps users look up the different curios in the game and gives them the different interactions the curios have with items or characters. Other sites that do this exist but they are either too clunky/obtuse to navigate & use or don't have the full list of curios. 

It was primarily made with HTML and CSS Flexbox but later on ported to React.JS to better display the information dynamically.
